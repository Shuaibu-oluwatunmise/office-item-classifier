Feedback from the Lecturer

Hi,

I read your report. It has a list of tasks and required skills. It makes good use of lists. 
It is consistent in terms of fonts and margins. It involves flow charts that explains the process. 
It involves hardware required with alternatives and comparison. It has references and they are cited in the report. 

It is a good report. I think you can also draw a diagram that shows where the robotic arm is located and shows where the objects are located (on the ground or on a table).  
Such a diagram would be good for understanding. 

Hi again, Your report is 3600 words, which exceeds the 3000-word limit. I think you should shorten it a bit.
